### Prereqs

I will be using Pipenv instead of just pip. It's awesome! https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Therefore, to setup things up activate the proper pipenv shell.


### Setup graphql

We will be using python with graphene against a sqlite DB. The reason for using sqlite instead of something else is because I don't want to keep and maintain postgres. It would require installing on my machine or using docker/k8s and that would be too much.
