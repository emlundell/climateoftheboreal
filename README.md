### Climate of the Boreal

__Here lies code for my blog at https://climateoftheboreal.blogspot.com__

There is a long gap between the halted start of this blog and now. I hope to bridge the gap.

Within _deprecated_ lies the first attempt that has died. While it was working okay, I really want to get to know other technologies like graphql which I think will think will lead to a better experience. I also want better code and doc organization. So to accomplish this, I'm starting out again. By using things that I've learned over the last three years or so at work, I hope to create a better project for myself and for those who read this repo.  

Within _code_ is where the processing happens. Earth data like wanted radiosondes are parsed and ingested into a DB for later use. Perhaps some basic satellite products are looked at. If something is suppose to be ran in another provider's platform liek AWS (and not on the local desktop), then files like cloudformation will be provided. Care is taken to simplicity and cleaness. Someone with little programming knowledge should be able to understand and reproduce my results without too much effort.

Within _studies_ is where the code needed to actually produce the numbers and graph plots for a particular study will be held. Also included will be the report the will usually become the blog post.
